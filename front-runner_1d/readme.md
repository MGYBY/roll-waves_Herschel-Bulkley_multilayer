The simulation of front-runner roll waves.

The simulation is conducted based on the **dimensionless** form of the governing equations for multilayer model by Audusse (Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems-B, 2005) and single-layer model by Ng & Mei (JFM, 1994).

For elaboration of the front runner, please refer to Yu & Chu (JFM, 2022) and Yu & Chu (JFM, 2023).
